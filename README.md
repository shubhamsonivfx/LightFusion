# LightFusion
LightFusion is a Nuke Python tool that automates the creation of a Multi-Light Beauty rebuild script. It works by selecting light layers and merging them using the plus operation, all inside a group node. The group nodeâ€™s properties panel is equipped with grading controls, allowing for quick and easy adjustments to the lighting layers.
